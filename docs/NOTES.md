# notes


  ## IMPORTANT!  from the ocamlopt docs:
  ## -o exec-file   Specify the name of the output file produced by the linker.
  ## That covers both executables and library archives (-a).
  ## If you're just compiling (-c), no need to pass -o.
  ## By contrast, the output files must be listed in the action output arg
  ## in order to be registered in the action dependency graph.
